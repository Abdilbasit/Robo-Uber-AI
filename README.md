# Robo-Uber-AI

## Overview

**Robo-Uber-AI** is an AI-powered simulation that models an autonomous ride-hailing system inspired by modern on-demand transportation services. The project leverages advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to simulate self-driving vehicle behavior, dynamic routing, and efficient dispatching. It serves as both a research testbed and a demonstration of how future transportation systems might operate autonomously.

## Features

- **Autonomous Navigation:** Simulates self-driving car behavior with AI algorithms for route planning and obstacle avoidance.
- **Dynamic Dispatching:** Models ride-hailing operations by matching passenger requests with available vehicles in real-time.
- **Optimized Routing:** Implements dynamic routing strategies to minimize wait times and improve overall system efficiency.
- **Modular Architecture:** Designed with a modular structure to facilitate easy extension and integration of new features or AI modules.
- **Visualization:** Offers a visual interface (or detailed logging) to observe vehicle movements, pickup and drop-off events, and system performance.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** The primary language used for simulation logic and AI model implementation.
- **Machine Learning Libraries:** Utilizes libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Scikit-Learn (adjust based on actual usage).
- **Simulation & Visualization Tools:** Incorporates frameworks for simulation and data visualization to display real-time system dynamics.
- **Additional Libraries:** Other Python packages for routing, data processing, and system monitoring.
